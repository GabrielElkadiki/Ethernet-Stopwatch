TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-2#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk is defined downstream of clock clk_out3_design_1_clk_wiz_1_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk is defined downstream of clock clk_out3_design_1_clk_wiz_1_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

The clocks clk_out3_design_1_clk_wiz_1_1 and design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out3_design_1_clk_wiz_1_1] -to [get_clocks design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

The clocks design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk and clk_out3_design_1_clk_wiz_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out3_design_1_clk_wiz_1_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
